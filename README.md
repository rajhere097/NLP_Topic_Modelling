# NLP_Topic_Modelling
This repository contains an NLP Topic Modelling project using preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stopword removal, POS tagging, and lemmatization. A Bag-of-Words model and LDA are applied to extract meaningful topics, along with topic visualization using pyLDAvis and detailed interpretation of results.
